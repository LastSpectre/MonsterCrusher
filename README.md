# MonsterCrusher
Scripts from the Virtual Reality Project Monster Crusher

Due to a massive time loss while working on this project, most of the logic was done in Blueprinting.
Many if not all classes though where setup with a C++ Class to enable easy accessability.
The VR Player was almost completely done in C++ and is basically a C++ Version of the Unreal VR Player Blueprint.
